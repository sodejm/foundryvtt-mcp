# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- Add bounded journal summaries with stable page IDs/UUIDs and explicit preview
  truncation, plus complete `get_journal_page` text/source retrieval. Preserve
  Unicode and HTML structure, describe non-text pages, and invalidate cursors
  when visible journal content or permissions change. Both tools advertise
  validated structured output and support delegated parent/page visibility.
